    The operation is guaranteed to be atomic, it will either successfully write the

    partially written object.

    This will use a multipart upload under the hood.

    Args:
        store: The ObjectStore instance to use.
        location: The path within ObjectStore for where to save the file.
        file: The object to upload. Can either be file-like, a `Path` to a local file,
            or a `bytes` object.
        chunk_size: The size of chunks to use within each part of the multipart upload. Defaults to 5 MB.
        max_concurrency: The maximum number of chunks to upload concurrently. Defaults to 12.
