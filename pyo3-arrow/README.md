Lightweight [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html) integration for [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/). Designed to make it easier for Rust libraries to add interoperable, zero-copy Python bindings.

Specifically, pyo3-arrow implements zero-copy FFI conversions between Python objects and Rust representations using the `arrow` crate. This relies heavily on the [Arrow PyCapsule Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html) for seamless interoperability across the Python Arrow ecosystem.

## Usage

We can wrap a function to be used in Python with just a few lines of code.

When you use a struct defined in `pyo3_arrow` as an argument to your function, it will automatically convert user input to a Rust `arrow` object via zero-copy FFI. Then once you're done, call `to_arro3` or `to_pyarrow` to export the data back to Python.

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3_arrow::error::PyArrowResult;
use pyo3_arrow::PyArray;

/// Take elements by index from an Array, creating a new Array from those
/// indexes.
#[pyfunction]
pub fn take(py: Python, values: PyArray, indices: PyArray) -> PyArrowResult<PyObject> {
    // We can call py.allow_threads to ensure the GIL is released during our
    // operations
    // This example just wraps `arrow_select::take::take`
    let output_array =
        py.allow_threads(|| arrow_select::take::take(values.as_ref(), indices.as_ref(), None))?;

    // Construct a PyArray and export it to the arro3 Python Arrow
    // implementation
    Ok(PyArray::new(output_array, values.field().clone()).to_arro3(py)?)
}
```

Then on the Python side, we can call this function (exported via `arro3.compute.take`):

```py
import pyarrow as pa
from arro3.compute import take

arr = pa.array([2, 3, 0, 1])
output = take(arr, arr)
output
# <arro3.core._rust.Array at 0x10787b510>
pa.array(output)
# <pyarrow.lib.Int64Array object at 0x10aa11000>
# [
#   0,
#   1,
#   2,
#   3
# ]
```

In this example, we use pyarrow to create the original array and to view the result, but the use of pyarrow is not required. It does, at least, show how the Arrow PyCapsule Interface makes it seamless to share these Arrow objects between Python Arrow implementations.

### Using Arrow data as input

Just include one of the pyo3-arrow structs in your function signature, and user input will be transparently converted

This uses the Arrow PyCapsule Interface. But note that that only defines _three_ methods, and `pyo3-arrow` contains more the three structs. Several structs are overloaded and use the same underlying transport mechanism.

For example, `PySchema` and `PyField` both use the `__arrow_c_schema__` mechanism, but with different behavior. The former expects the transported field to be a struct type, and its children get unpacked to be the fields of the schema, while the latter has no constraint and passes a field through as-is. `PySchema` will error if the passed field is not of struct type.

| Struct name | Unpacks struct field |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `PySchema`  | Yes                  |
| `PyField`   | No                   |

`PyArray` and `PyRecordBatch` both use the `__arrow_c_array__` mechanism:

| Struct name     | Unpacks `StructArray` to `RecordBatch` |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `PyRecordBatch` | Yes                                    |
| `PyArray`       | No                                     |

`PyTable`, `PyChunkedArray`, and `PyRecordBatchReader` all use the `__arrow_c_stream__` mechanism:

| Struct name           | Unpacks `StructArray` to `RecordBatch` | Materializes in memory |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `PyTable`             | Yes                                    | Yes                    |
| `PyRecordBatchReader` | Yes                                    | No                     |
| `PyChunkedArray`      | No                                     | Yes                    |
| `PyArrayReader`       | No                                     | No                     |

### Returning Arrow data back to Python

#### Using your own classes

If you're exporting your own Arrow-compatible classes to Python, you can implement the relevant Arrow PyCapsule Interface methods directly on your own classes.

You can use the helper functions `to_array_pycapsules`, `to_schema_pycapsule`, and `to_stream_pycapsule` in the [`ffi` module](https://docs.rs/pyo3-arrow/latest/pyo3_arrow/ffi/index.html) to simplify exporting your data.

To export stream data, add a method to your class with the following signature:

```rs
use arrow_array::ArrayRef;
use arrow_schema::FieldRef;
use pyo3_arrow::ffi::{to_stream_pycapsule, ArrayIterator};
use pyo3::types::PyCapsule;

fn __arrow_c_stream__<'py>(
    &'py self,
    py: Python<'py>,
    requested_schema: Option<Bound<'py, PyCapsule>>,
) -> PyResult<Bound<'py, PyCapsule>> {
    let field: FieldRef = ...;
    let arrays: Vec<ArrayRef> = ...;
    let array_reader =
        Box::new(ArrayIterator::new(arrays.into_iter().map(Ok), field));
    to_stream_pycapsule(py, array_reader, requested_schema)
}
```

Exporting schema or array data is similar, just with the `__arrow_c_schema__` and `__arrow_c_array__` methods instead.

If you don't wish to export your own classes, refer to one of the solutions below.

#### Using `arro3.core`

[`arro3.core`](https://github.com/kylebarron/arro3) is a very minimal Python Arrow implementation, designed to be lightweight (<1MB) and relatively stable. In comparison, pyarrow is on the order of ~100MB.

You must depend on the `arro3-core` Python package; then you can use the `to_arro3` method of each exported Arrow object to pass the data into an `arro3.core` class.

| Rust struct           | arro3 class                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `PyField`             | `arro3.core.Field`             |
| `PySchema`            | `arro3.core.Schema`            |
| `PyArray`             | `arro3.core.Array`             |
| `PyArrayReader`       | `arro3.core.ArrayReader`       |
| `PyRecordBatch`       | `arro3.core.RecordBatch`       |
| `PyChunkedArray`      | `arro3.core.ChunkedArray`      |
| `PyTable`             | `arro3.core.Table`             |
| `PyRecordBatchReader` | `arro3.core.RecordBatchReader` |

#### Using `pyarrow`

[`pyarrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html), the canonical Python Arrow implementation, is a very large dependency. It's roughly 100MB in size on its own, plus 35MB more for its hard dependency on numpy. However, `numpy` is very likely already in the user environment, and `pyarrow` is quite common as well, so requiring a `pyarrow` dependency may not be a problem.

In this case, you must depend on `pyarrow` and you can use the `to_pyarrow` method of Python structs to return data to Python. This requires `pyarrow>=14` (`pyarrow>=15` is required to return `PyRecordBatchReader`).

| Rust struct           | pyarrow class               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `PyField`             | `pyarrow.Field`             |
| `PySchema`            | `pyarrow.Schema`            |
| `PyArray`             | `pyarrow.Array`             |
| `PyRecordBatch`       | `pyarrow.RecordBatch`       |
| `PyChunkedArray`      | `pyarrow.ChunkedArray`      |
| `PyTable`             | `pyarrow.Table`             |
| `PyRecordBatchReader` | `pyarrow.RecordBatchReader` |

`pyarrow` does not have the equivalent of a `PyArrayReader`, but if the materialized data fits in memory, you can convert a `PyArrayReader` to a `PyChunkedArray` and pass that to `pyarrow`.

#### Using `nanoarrow`

[`nanoarrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/latest/index.html) is an alternative Python library for working with Arrow data. It's similar in goals to arro3, but is written in C instead of Rust. Additionally, it has a smaller type system than `pyarrow` or `arro3`, with logical arrays and record batches both represented by the `nanoarrow.Array` class.

In this case, you must depend on `nanoarrow` and you can use the `to_nanoarrow` method of Python structs to return data to Python.

| Rust struct           | nanoarrow class         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `PyField`             | `nanoarrow.Schema`      |
| `PySchema`            | `nanoarrow.Schema`      |
| `PyArray`             | `nanoarrow.Array`       |
| `PyRecordBatch`       | `nanoarrow.Array`       |
| `PyArrayReader`       | `nanoarrow.ArrayStream` |
| `PyChunkedArray`      | `nanoarrow.ArrayStream` |
| `PyTable`             | `nanoarrow.ArrayStream` |
| `PyRecordBatchReader` | `nanoarrow.ArrayStream` |

## Version compatibility

| pyo3-arrow | pyo3 | arrow-rs |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- |
| 0.1.x      | 0.21 | 52       |
| 0.2.x      | 0.21 | 52       |
| 0.3.x      | 0.21 | 53       |
| 0.4.x      | 0.21 | 53       |
| 0.5.x      | 0.22 | 53       |

## Buffer Protocol

pyo3-arrow will automatically interpret Python objects that implement the [Python Buffer Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html). This is implemented as part of the `FromPyObject` impl on `PyArray`. So if your function accepts `PyArray`, it will automatically accept buffer protocol input. This conversion is zero-copy.

Multi-dimensional buffer protocol objects are interpreted as nested fixed size lists.

Buffer protocol support is behind a `buffer_protocol` feature flag (turned on by default), as it requires either the `abi3-py311` pyo3 feature or building non-abi3 wheels.

## Why not use arrow-rs's Python integration?

arrow-rs has [some existing Python integration](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/pyarrow/index.html), but there are a few reasons why I created `pyo3-arrow`:

- arrow-rs's Python FFI integration **does not support Arrow extension types**, because it omits field metadata when constructing an `Arc<dyn Array>`. pyo3-arrow gets around this by storing both an `ArrayRef` (`Arc<dyn Array>`) and a `FieldRef` (`Arc<Field>`) in a `PyArray` struct.
- arrow-rs has no ability to work with an Arrow stream of bare arrays that are not record batches, and so **arrow-rs has no way to interop with a `pyarrow.ChunkedArray` or `polars.Series`**.
- pyo3-arrow will **automatically convert Python buffer protocol objects** (such as numpy arrays, `memoryview`s, `bytes` objects, and more) to `PyArray`. This conversion is zero copy.
- **arrow-rs only supports returning data to pyarrow**. Pyarrow is a very large dependency (its unpacked Linux wheels are 130MB, not including a required dependency on Numpy) and some projects may wish not to use it. Now that the Arrow PyCapsule interface exists, it's possible to have a modular approach, where a very small library contains core Arrow objects, and works seamlessly with other libraries.
- pyo3-arrow implements [schema negotiation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html#schema-requests) for the PyCapsule Interface on data export, allowing other Python libraries to request Arrow data types they know how to handle.
- In my opinion arrow-rs is too tightly connected to pyo3 and pyarrow. pyo3 releases don't line up with arrow-rs's release cadence, which means it could be a bit of a wait to use the latest pyo3 version with arrow-rs, especially with arrow-rs [waiting longer to release breaking changes](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs#release-versioning-and-schedule).
